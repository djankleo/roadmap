# Official Public Roadmap for Gitpod

[The roadmap](https://github.com/gitpod-io/roadmap/projects/1) serves as a broad overview of the future of Gitpod. Its purpose is to communicate where we are heading with the product and with what concrete steps we are getting closer to our mission of ***providing a frictionless developer experience through automated, disposable dev environments***.

While we seriously aim to design, implement, and deliver the things listed below, we regularly update this page when life happens. So don't take the items listed here as granted. Also, while the current quarter is finalized and doesn't change much, the future is to be understood more like a backlog.
